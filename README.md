Live version: https://jenovs.github.io/spotify-clone (then click `browse` - it's temporary solution :)

This is a practice project to sharpen my React and Redux skills. It's an attempt to clone Spotify web app functionality.  
Currently only `FEATURED` tab is functional.  

Back-end part to obtain the authentication token is written on Go and hosted on AWS.  

Front-end part is temporary hosted on GitHub Pages (there are some issues with client side routing when using GitHub Pages, therefore I'm planning to host also the front-end code on AWS.)  

### Installation
Clone the repo and run `yarn install` and then `yarn run-all`.
