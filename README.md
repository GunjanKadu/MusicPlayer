Live version: https://spotify-clone.jenovs.com

In May 2017 I decided to put my newly learned React/Redux skills to test and clone Spotify webapp.

After few weeks this project was added to the 'finish later' pile.

Fast forward to January 2018 and it's *later* enough for a second attempt :)

### Installation
Clone the repo and run `npm i` and then `npm run start-all`.
