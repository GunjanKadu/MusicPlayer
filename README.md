This is a practice project to sharpen my React and Redux skills. It's an attempt to clone Spotify web app functionality.  
Currently only `FEATURED` tab is functional.  

Back-end part to obtain the authentication token is written on Go.

### Installation
Clone the repo and run `yarn install` and then `yarn start-all`.
